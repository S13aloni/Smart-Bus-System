# üöå Dashboard Fixes & Ahmedabad Integration Summary

## ‚úÖ **Error Fixed Successfully**

### **Problem Identified**
The error was occurring in `Dashboard.tsx` at line:
```typescript
const activeBuses = busesData.filter(bus => bus.status === 'active').length;
```

### **Root Cause**
The `BusData` interface was updated to use specific status literals:
```typescript
status: 'on_time' | 'delayed' | 'cancelled' | 'breakdown' | 'maintenance'
```

But the Dashboard component was still checking for `'active'` which is no longer a valid status.

### **Solution Applied**
Updated the filter to use the correct status values:
```typescript
const activeBuses = busesData.filter(bus => bus.status === 'on_time' || bus.status === 'delayed').length;
```

## üöÄ **Enhanced Dashboard Features**

### **1. Updated Statistics Interface**
```typescript
interface StatsOverviewProps {
  stats: {
    totalBuses: number;
    activeBuses: number;
    operationalBuses: number;  // NEW
    totalRoutes: number;
    avgOccupancy: number;
    breakdowns: number;        // NEW
  };
  alerts: number;
}
```

### **2. New Statistics Calculations**
- **Active Buses**: Buses with status 'on_time' or 'delayed'
- **Operational Buses**: Buses where `is_operational = true`
- **Breakdowns**: Buses with status 'breakdown'
- **Total Buses**: All buses in the fleet
- **Average Occupancy**: Real-time occupancy percentage
- **Active Alerts**: Weather, traffic, and breakdown alerts

### **3. Ahmedabad-Specific Dashboard Cards**
1. **Total Buses**: "Ahmedabad Fleet" - Shows total fleet size
2. **Operational Buses**: Shows percentage of working buses
3. **Ahmedabad Routes**: "8 Active" - Real Ahmedabad routes
4. **Avg Occupancy**: "Peak Hours" - Current passenger load
5. **Breakdowns**: "Needs Repair" / "All Good" - Bus maintenance status
6. **Active Alerts**: "Weather/Traffic" / "All Clear" - Real-time alerts

## üéØ **Real-World Problem Solving**

### **Bus Status Management**
- **On Time**: Buses running according to schedule
- **Delayed**: Buses behind schedule (weather, traffic, etc.)
- **Cancelled**: Routes cancelled due to breakdowns or weather
- **Breakdown**: Buses out of service due to mechanical issues
- **Maintenance**: Buses undergoing scheduled maintenance

### **Operational Status Tracking**
- **is_operational**: Boolean flag indicating if bus can run
- **Weather Impact**: Speed reduction due to rain, fog, storm
- **Traffic Condition**: Normal, heavy, jam, clear
- **Breakdown Reason**: Detailed reason for bus failure
