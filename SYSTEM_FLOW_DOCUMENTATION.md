### **3. Weather & Breakdown Handling**

#### **A. Weather Impact System** 🌧️
```
Normal Weather → Base Speed: 25-40 km/h
Rain → Speed Reduction: 20% (20-32 km/h)
Heavy Rain → Speed Reduction: 40% (15-24 km/h)
Fog → Speed Reduction: 20% (20-32 km/h)
Storm → Speed Reduction: 40% (15-24 km/h)
```

**Alert Generation**:

- **Severity Levels**: Critical (Storm), High (Heavy Rain), Medium (Rain/Fog)

#### **B. Bus Breakdown System** 🔧
**Breakdown Reasons**:
- Engine failure
- Brake system issue
- Tire puncture
- Electrical problem
- Fuel system malfunction

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Status Change**: Bus status → 'breakdown'
2. **Route Cancellation**: Route marked as cancelled
3. **Alert Generation**: "Bus BUS-001 has broken down due to engine failure. Route 1 is cancelled until replacement bus arrives."
4. **Passenger Notification**: Real-time updates to affected passengers
